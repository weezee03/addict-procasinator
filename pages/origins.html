      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <p>
        In 1990, Rowling was on a crowded train from Manchester to London when the idea for Harry suddenly "fell into her head". Rowling gives an account of the experience on her website saying:[55]
      </p>
      <p class="grey_font">
        I had been writing almost continuously since the age of six but I had never been so excited about an idea before. I simply sat and thought, for four (delayed train) hours, and all the details bubbled up in my brain, and this scrawny,
        black-haired, bespectacled boy who did not know he was a wizard became more and more real to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rowling completed Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in 1995 and the manuscript was sent off to several prospective agents.[56] The second agent she tried, Christopher Little, offered to represent her and sent the manuscript to
        Bloomsbury.
